<h3> My Investment Framework </h3>
<p>

</p>
    <h4><a href="https://athelas.com/">Athelas</a></h4>
    <p> They use computer vision to tackle low-volume blood testing. Think theranos, or Quest Diagnostics (NYSE: DGX), but using deep learning convolutional networks to detect various blood biomarkers. Though I have no knowledge of their traction, product roadmap, KPIs, or the inner workings of their algorithms (I would thoroughly do diligence here),
    I am assuming the core of their technological innovation uses a certain technique in blood staining and computer vision to count white and red blood cells.
    My investment thesis is based on the belief that computer-vision techniques can be used to track and measure, with greater than 8-bit resolution, various blood biomarkers.
    Athelas, with clinical data showing efficacy on the simplest blood test, has the potential to track other important markers in blood and provide the fastest, lowest volume blood test in the sector.
    I believe most people are ignoring the blood testing industry because startups like Theranos left a bad taste in people’s mouths. The blood testing industry, however, is $51B in the USA and techniques haven’t changed in decades.
    This type of technology could double the size of the industry by increasing the accessibility of blood tests and the frequency at which they are completed. An analog would be how Uber/Lyft (access & frequency) led to large market growth in car-sharing services.
    The future potential is clear: longitudinal health data doesn’t exist because it is arduous and expensive to collect and share in a standard format. Athelas, if the technology can laterally move into tracking other blood biomarkers using computer vision,
    will unlock massive opportunities in diagnostics, therapeutic development, and overall consumer health.
